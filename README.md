A console-based Hangman game developed in C language as a first-semester project at FAST-NU. This project marked the beginning of our programming journey, where we explored the fundamentals of C while building something fun, interactive, and meaningful.

Built with 💻 Zaid Bin Kamal and Talha Ali Khan, this game helped us dive deep into logic-building, file handling, and collaborative coding.

##🚀 Features
